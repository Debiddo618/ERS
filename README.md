## :pencil: Descriptions:

The backend for the Employee Reimbursement System is developed using Java and the Spring Framework, with Spring Security and JWT implemented for user authentication and OAuth. It integrates a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS for reliable data management. The application is fully dockerized and deployed on an EC2 instance, ensuring efficient operation and scalability. However, its availability is constrained to the duration of the AWS free tier period. The frontend for this application is accessible through this [GitHub repository.](https://github.com/Debiddo618/ERS-Frontend)

## :satellite: Next Steps:

Here are some potential improvements to the project:

- Currently, any manager can promote or demote employees/managers. Therefore, I might want to create a single super manager that can manage promoting/demoting mannagers.
