## :pencil: Descriptions:

The backend for the Employee Reimbursement System is developed using <b>Java</b> and the <b>Spring Framework</b>, with <b>Spring Security</b> and <b>JWT</b> implemented for user authentication and OAuth. It integrates a <b>PostgreSQL</b> database hosted on <b>AWS</b> for reliable data management. The application is fully <b>dockerized</b> and deployed on an <b>EC2</b> instance, ensuring efficient operation and scalability. However, its availability is constrained to the duration of the AWS free tier period. The frontend for this application is accessible through this [GitHub repository.](https://github.com/Debiddo618/ERS-Frontend)

## :satellite: Next Steps:

Here are some potential improvements to the project:

- Currently, any manager can promote or demote employees/managers. Therefore, I might want to create a single super manager that can manage promoting/demoting mannagers.
